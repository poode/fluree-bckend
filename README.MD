# Fluree Backend

## For Developing
You will need to run 
1- `nvm i`
2- `npm i`
3- `npm run start:dev`

# Using Docker for testing the demo
Please run `npm run start:docker` but make sure that you have two instances of fluree installed and up on different ports
not two transactor group for one instance of fluree NO, two instances I preferred using docker way to install fluree.

# NOTE
This repo is not completed and will continue once I have time for it as fluree is so promising for web3 Dapps.
